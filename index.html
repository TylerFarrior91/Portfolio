            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello there! I'm Tyler Farrior, an automotive technician with a
                strong background in automotive quality. With a keen
                understanding of automotive repairs and a knack for finding bad
                defects, I specialize in identifying root causes of quality
                problems. I had the incredible opportunity to contribute to
                Rivian's production startup, specifically on their R1-T truck,
                where I played a vital role in ensuring top-notch quality and
                precise body fitting work.
                While my automotive expertise has been a significant part of my
                journey, I've recently embarked on an exciting career transition
                into software development. Currently enrolled at Vanderbilt
                University's coding boot camp, I'm eagerly expanding my skills
                and knowledge in the ever-evolving world of technology.
                Beyond my professional pursuits, my most cherished
                accomplishment is being married to the most amazing wife. She is
                my rock, providing unwavering support and encouragement as I
                navigate through life's adventures.
                Moreover, I'm a proud father to two wonderful kids who
                constantly inspire me to strive for excellence and embrace new
                challenges.
                With a combination of automotive expertise, leadership skills,
                and my passion for coding, I'm excited to leverage my diverse
                background to drive innovation and deliver exceptional results.
                Join me on this journey as we push boundaries and make a
                positive impact together.</p>
